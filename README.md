# Note Taker

## Description
This application allows the user to make new notes and delete old ones. Using Express.js as a back-end, the application stores all the note data in a JSON file and retrieves said information when needed. When the application is first open, the user will be presented with a screen that includes a link to the notes page. Once clicked, the user is taken to a screen where they can write a new note, save the note for later use, or clear the form before the note is saved. If they have any saved notes, they can click on said note, and the back-end will retrieve the note from the JSON file. Otherwise, they can delete the note, which will erase the data from the JSON file.

For local testing, please clone the repo using "git clone git@github.com:lowerym/note-taker.git" and running "npm i" followed by "node server.js"
